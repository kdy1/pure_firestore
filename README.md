# pure_firestore

Pure dart firestore client.

Currently, I use the library only for testing, but I may make it compatible with official firestore clients.

Note that the library is in very early stage.

## Roadmap

 - [x] Test using firestore emulator (with firestore.rules)
 - [ ] Snapshot listeners.
 - [ ] Transaction (maybe, as I don't use transaction from a client)
 - [ ] Batch (maybe, as I don't use batch from a client)
